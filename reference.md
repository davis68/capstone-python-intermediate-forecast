##  [Introduction](01-intro.html)

*   Web data sources change and update from time to time.
    Sometimes an API is specified, sometimes not.

*   We can use the `requests` module to obtain Web data as
    plain text (HTML) and then scrape through the resulting
    string to extract our data.

*   Test-driven development allows us to specify what each part
    of a software program does *in isolation*, and then to put
    those parts together confident that they will work.


##  [Test-Driven Development](02-tdd.html)

*   We can specify the behavior of program components ahead of time
    based on our requirements.  This makes sure that we have a logical
    structure for our program and process.

*   Test-driven development allows us to specify what each part
    of a software program does *in isolation*, and then to put
    those parts together confident that they will work.


##  [Extracting Web Data](03-web.html)

*   Several Python libraries for obtaining data from a URL exist.
    `requests` is the most modern and the most convenient for
    today's purposes.

*   We can use the `requests` module to obtain Web data as
    plain text (HTML) and then scrape through the resulting
    string to extract our data.


##  [Putting It All Together](04-all.html)

*   Since we specified our program behavior, we should be able to
    independently test and compose our program's behavior.  Therefore,
    when we put things together, they should work if we did our job

*   Use pipelines of command-line tools to build a program piecemeal.

*   Put all work under version control.
